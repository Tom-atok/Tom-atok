# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio
## About Me
I am a researcher in **Computational Social Science**, with a focus on communication. My primary interest lies in using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to quantitatively measure **collective consciousness** within social groups. By leveraging the power of data science and IT, I aim to advance research in the **humanities** and **social sciences**, particularly by promoting the use of NLP techniques in **Japanese** and encouraging their broader application in the field of **social sciences**.


## Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **NLP Techniques**: Topic modeling, LDA, Word Embeddings, Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Research Interests**: Communication analysis, Collective consciousness, Quantitative research

## Projects
### 1. **Analyzing Communication on Blogging Platforms: A Case Study of "note"**
This project involved analyzing user-generated content on the popular Japanese blogging platform **note**. Using NLP techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis, I explored how collective thoughts and trends emerge within the platform’s communities.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Gensim, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Key Outcomes**: Identified major themes and collective sentiment trends, providing insight into community behavior and content engagement.

### 2. **Google Colaboratory Notebooks for Humanities and Social Sciences**
I believe that IT technologies have significant potential to enhance research in the **humanities** and **social sciences**. As part of my effort to bridge the gap between these disciplines and data science, I have created several **Google Colaboratory notebooks** that demonstrate the application of machine learning and data analysis in these fields.

## Wiki & IT Hacks
I have created a personal **wiki** where I compile various **IT hacks** and techniques that I often use in my research and work. This wiki is a reference for myself and others who may find it helpful. I realized that I often repeat the same tasks or explain them to others but tend to forget the details. To avoid constantly searching for information or asking GPT, I summarize these topics in a structured format.

Most of the content is based on information generated by **ChatGPT**, which I fact-check and adjust before adding to the wiki. Here’s an overview of the topics covered:

### **IT Hack Topics**
- **Python**: Practical tips and techniques for efficient coding and data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Configuration guide for setting up `nbstripout` to prevent tracking of metadata and outputs (macOS M3).
- **GPT Utilization**: Methods for leveraging GPT in various workflows.
- **Python & Pandas**: Data sampling and manipulation techniques using both Python and ChatGPT.
- **Google Workspace**: Step-by-step instructions for sending emails from Google Group addresses.
- **Markdown**: Why Markdown is a simple and efficient tool for writing structured content.
- **Other Useful Tools**: Including a **Zotero guide** for managing bibliographies and references.
